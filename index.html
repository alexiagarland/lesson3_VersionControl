            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that stores files that other people check over before they get set for good.  A long time ago, even though version control was supposed to be the best, errors were found.  They then decided to further the study and came out with version control system.  Version controls systems is a system that allows you to pretty much anything from revert files back to their original state to seeing who last changed something.  It allows easy recovery if suddenly the files get lost.  It immediately keeps track of who changed the files, when they were changed, what about them was changed, and merge changed to the same file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working with Git, you use and learn about remote repository.  Remote repositories are basically the versions of your product on an Internet base.  These servers, that the remote repositories on are shared on, are through out many teams. This is not to be confused with Local repository, which is a way for servers to stick to an individual or local machine.  They take data and push and pull the data to wherever they need it to go work.  Within Git are Git remote commands that remote repositories are stored in.  This command will let you list all of the commands that are under your terminal. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local repository is a little different to remote repository.  Instead of residing on a remote server, the local repository resided on an individual or local machine.  When creating a local repository, you have to be ability to clone everything on a repository.   This is kind of what we would consider GIT.  This fine became very error prone because of the files, so they decided to take the issue on head-on and created a more simpler database.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git it a type of VCS that runs and saves its files a little differently than other systems.  They take the information that is trying to be saved and/or changed and think of it as a set of files.  In other systems, they take the files and list them. For every change that is made to a file, if ther are any, comes a link to the previous file.  Basically, after each change, git takes a screenshot of what it previously look like before the changes.From there, it pairs up that new link with the previous one in case someone need to look at the previous one to see what changes were wrong.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Along with Git comes Git commands.  Git commands allow you to tell the terminal what you would like for them to do.  Git commands allow you to make file changes, remove files, show status' for files, merge branches, save changes, etc. These commands make it easier for you to be able to operate what command you are trying to get the computer to do.  Without these, it would be very hard to navigate and keep track of files that are on the computer.  These Git commands allow you to pull up the screenshots of the files that were saved on and paired up together.
